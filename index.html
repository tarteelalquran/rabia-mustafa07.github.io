			<h4>About Me</h4>
		<div>
			<!-- if you can read this you should smile -->
			<p>My name is Rabia Mustafa. I love painting, it gives me lots of creative freedom to make whatever I want. Painting is an escape for me, 
			I can sit all day and just paint. I love discovering different types of painting techniques and methods.<p>
			<p>Since I was little I have watched my mom paint and it made me fall in love with it. I first started with Oil Pastels but quickly figured
			that was not for me. I then moved on to using water colors. Water colors was a lot more fun. I painted everything and anything. I got interested
			in Acrylic and started experimenting more with acrylic paints. Now I prefer to use acrylic paints but I still love experimenting with all different
			types of techniques.<p>
